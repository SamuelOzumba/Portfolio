Learning outcome: what did I learn

# LEARNING DIARY
I checked the general information and understood the main focus of the course, which is to find my passion as a software developer and create a unique project to represent my skills. I chose frontend module because it was the most interesting project offered. Iâ€™ve also tried to set up my environment, I used the visual studio code editor and installed some extensions. I also created a github account and I learned to set up a git repository.
